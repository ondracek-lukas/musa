      The application is now in development and it is NOT WORKING yet.


      The MusA (musical analyser) application aims to draw an image
      illustrating played tones, their timbres, etc.
      to the given audio stream (file, microphone, ...).

Dependencies:
  OpenGL, Freeglut 3.0
  PulseAudio, libav-tools


The application itself expects a binary stream of floats of audio samples
on standard input, therefore it is recommended to run the wrapper scripts
musa-mic (for real-time input audio processing)
and musa-file (for audio file processing).

Simple usage:
  musa-file --file file.mp3
  musa-mic

For more options run:
  musa -?
  musa-file -?
  musa-mic -?


The interface (including options and wrappers) will change in later versions.

  VERSION for current version of the application
