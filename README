      The Spectrograph application performs Fast Fourier Transform
      on audio input (from file or microphone) and
      draws its spectrogram (in real time).

Dependencies:
  OpenGL, Freeglut 3.0
  PulseAudio, libav-tools


The application itself expects a binary stream of floats of audio samples
on standard input, therefore it is recommended to run the wrapper scripts
spectrograph-mic (for real-time input audio processing)
and spectrograph-file (for audio file processing).

Simple usage:
  spectrograph-file --file file.mp3
  spectrograph-mic

For more options run:
  spectrograph -?
  spectrograph-file -?
  spectrograph-mic -?


The interface (including options and wrappers) will change in later versions.
